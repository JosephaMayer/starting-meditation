An opinionated, minimalistic how-to guide for meditation.

# Todo
- Configure nginx to pick up starting-meditation.com (without www)
- Change link to Github from Mattis' profile to this specific repo
- Use Hemingway to find hard-to-read sentences
- Use Grammarly to identify spelling and grammar mistakes
- Use media queries to make headings smaller / larger on mobile
- Maybe write something about mindfulness
- Add missing paragraphs on philosophy
