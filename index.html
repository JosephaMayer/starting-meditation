        <h2 id="why">Why meditate?</h2>
        <p>You don't have to practice meditation.</p>
        <p>But if you're like me, you find yourself feeling anxious too often. You might also have a hard time dealing with distractions.</p>
        <p>For people like you and me, meditation can be a way to calm down and be more focused, aware, and in the moment. Which is helpful both at work and with friends and family.</p>
        <p>There are other methods for reaching the same goal. The reasons I meditate are that it's free, I can do it almost anywhere, and a lot of studies have proven it works.</p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p>Now, there's no need to buy any statues of the Buddha, to learn to sit cross-legged, or to grow a beard. Meditation is basically just sitting and breathing.</p>
        <p>We associate meditation with Asian religions but in fact, there's nothing religious about it. Just sitting and breathing. Let's try it out.</p>

            <h2 id="basic-technique">The basic technique</h2>
            <p>It's easy to meditate. Find a place where you can be undisturbed for your session, and set a timer for 10 minutes.</p>
            <h3 id="posture">Posture</h3>
            <p>Sit with a straight back. You can sit in a chair, or on the floor, or standing up. You could also be laying down, but then you might fall asleep.</p>
            <p>Eyes open or eyes closed? You pick.</p>
            <h3 id="breathing">Breathing</h3>
            <p>Just breathe. You don't have to practice deep breathing.
            <p>But if that calms you, feel free to do it. If so, start out by putting a hand on your stomach. Feel it expand on the in-breath and collapse on the out-breath.</p>
            <p>After a minute or so, just leave the breath be.</p>
            <h3 id="thinking">Thinking</h3>
            <p>Feel yourself breathing.</p>
            <p>As soon as you notice that you're no longer aware of your breath, bring the breath back into your awareness.</p>
            <p>Have the intention to stay present with your breath, but don't get mad at yourself if you start daydreaming. It happens to all of us.</p>
            <p>Thinking is not a bad thing. We need thinking for all intelligent activites. However, sometimes, we think too much – we ruminate on things that we could just as well let go of.</p>

          <p>When you start out, it might be helpful to have some guidande for your meditation practice.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, there are a lot of great resources available for free online.</p>
          <p>You can download MP3s from <a href="http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22">UCLA's website</a>. Or subscribe to <a href="https://www.tarabrach.com/guided-meditations/">Tara Brach's podcast</a> – there you'll find more than a hundred guided meditations.</p>
          <h3 id="apps">Apps & trinkets</h3>
          <p>There are a bunch of mobile apps that provide guided meditations for you. The most popular is called <a href="http://www.headspace.com">Headspace</a>. It's quite expensive, but it is very nice looking and has a lot of helpful content.</p>
          <p>Other options are Calm.com and Buddhify.</p>
          <p>I use an app called <strong>Meditation Timer</strong>, which provides me with a nice bell at the beginning and end of each session.</p>
          <p>In the last year, a number of meditation trinkets have popped up in the market. Based on reviews and testing, they are not good enough yet. But in a few years, tools like Thync, Spire and Muse Headband will make it easier to meditate with bio-feedback.</p>

        <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
        <p>Meditation is simple, but it's not easy. In your practice, you'll run in to a couple of challenges.</p>

        <h4>If you find that you don't have the time to meditate.</h4>
        <p>Then it's fine. Perhaps you need <span style="font-style: italic">less</span> stuff to do. Not another thing to keep track of.</p>

        <h4>If you find that you're thinking, constantly.</h4>
        <p>That's OK too. Notice the thoughts, go back to being aware of your breath. You have only failed when you give up. Don't give up.</p>

        <h4>If you spend more time reading about meditation than practicing.</h4>
        <p>Only allow yourself theory after practice.</p>

        <h4>If your back hurts from sitting straight.</h4>
        <p>Stretch for a couple of minutes before each meditation session.</p>

        <h4>If you don't feel more calm and focused.</h4>
        <p>Then perhaps meditation doesn't work for you. Do an experiment with another exercise and compare the results.</p>

        <h4>If you can't find a room for meditation.</h4>
        <p>Then do it wherever. You don't have to shut out the noise. Just listen to it, like you're listening to your breath.</p>

        <h4>If you feel sad / angry / irritated.</h4>
        <p>That's fine. Meditation is not about forcing happiness. It's about being present with what is. Nothing wrong with a li'l sadness.</p>

        <p>-</p>
        <p>The only "real" challenge with meditation is consistency. To keep at it every day for years. That requires prioritization and grit. It also requires that you don't switch methods. Even if a new meditation technique looks exciting, stick to what you got.</p>

      <h2 id="books">Book recommendations</h2>
      <p>You need neither books, apps nor gadget to meditate. But if you're like me, you want to understand how the tool works under the hood.</p>
      <p>The best secular books on meditation are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Waking Up by Sam Harris.</li>
        <li>The Mayo Clinic Guide to Stress-Free Living by Dr. Amit Sood.</li>
        <li>Seach Inside Yourself by Chade Meng-Tan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also find some good meditation techniques in religious scripture from all the world's religions. But there's no need to bother with that if you don't want to.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-7 columns">
      <h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
      <p>In your meditation practice, you will be able to explore a couple of philosophical questions.</p>
      <p><ul>
      <li>Is there anything permanent in the world, or are all things impermanent?</li>
      <li>We say "I have a brain," but who is this "I" that has a brain?</li>
      <li>Does the future and past exist, and if so, where?</li>
      <li>Where would you be without air, and what chain of events created that air for you?</li>
      <li>Can you decide which thoughts arise in your mind?</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You don't have to do any active work to ponder these questions when you do meditation. Just sit and breathe.</p>

      <h2 id="next-level">Next-level practice</h2>
      <p>Once you've done 10 minutes of meditation every day for 30 days, you can go to the next level. If you did it for 26, and not 30 days, start over until you actually have 30 days consecutive training.</p>
      <p>This is important, because continuity is more important than the quality of your practice. You will get results if you're consistent.</p>
      <p>The same pattern is true for all of these goals. There's no need to do a 10-day silent retreat if you're not regularly sitting for 40 minutes every day. There's no rush.</p>
      <h4>Level 2: 20 minutes of meditation every day. </h4><p>Goal: hit 30 consecutive days.</p>
      <h4>Level 3: 40 minutes of meditation every day. </h4><p>Goal: hit 30 consecutive days.</p>
      <h4>Level 4: Try out a 10-day silent retreat. </h4><p>Goal: you've completed a retreat.</p>
      <h4>Level 5: Start a meditation group. </h4> <p>Goal: you meet regularly each week.</p>
      <h4>Level 6: Learn different types of meditation.</h4> <p>Goal: you know the difference between concentration, open awareness, insight, and metta meditation. You can switch awareness objects: breath, words, visualization.</p>
      <h4>Level 7: Learn supporting practices.</h4> <p>Goal: you've mastered breathing exercises that help steady your mind.</p>
      <h4>Level 8: Enlightenment.</h4> <p>Just kidding :) There is no such thing.</p>
